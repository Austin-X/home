		<h2 class = "soccer"> Soccer </h2>
		<p> Soccer is a ball game played by two teams. It is a team game and was invented in the mid 19th century.
		Not to confuse it with other types of it, like American football, rugby, or Gaelic football, the official name of this sport is called association football.
		But in Canada, we usually just call it soccer. It is know as the most popular sport worldwide because of how easily the game can be played and the simplicity of it.
		The first ever soccer match was played on Barnes common at Mortlake, London on 19th December 1863 between Barnes Football Club and Richmond Football Club.  
		There are many great soccer players in the world, such as Ronaldo, Neymar, Pele, and Beckham, but my favourite soccer player is Messi.</p>

        <h4 class = "icehockey"> Ice Hockey </h4>
	        <p> Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a vulcanized rubber disc called a puck.
		This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice. The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other countries around the world.
		It is the most popular sport in Canada, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. In Canada, it is the national sport. 
		The objective in this game is to skate around the rink with your team and try to score in the enemy&rsquo;s net usng the hockey stick.
		As you can see in the image, the hockey stick is the long wooden curved stick and the puck is the rubber disc beside it. </p>
